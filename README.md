The geography of India is extremely diverse, with landscape ranging
from snow-capped mountain ranges to deserts, plains, hills and
plateaus.Though the state government claims to have built several
roads in rural areas, the data shows that hundreds of villages do not
have connectivity with major connecting roads.Due to the poor
connectivity ,villages are deprived direct access to their
requirements .
